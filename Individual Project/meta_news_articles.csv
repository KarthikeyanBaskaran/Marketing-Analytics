We're starting to see return on AI investments: Portfolio manager,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/were-starting-see-return-ai-211908987.html,"Most Magnificent Seven tech stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) so far this year, and the tech sector is attempting a recovery from a lackluster third quarter. The Magnificent Seven is currently comprised of Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Dominic Rizzo joins Market Domination to discuss how investors can best play the tech sector. Many investors were disappointed during the second quarter earnings season as they looked for significant returns on their AI plays. Rizzo expects this theme to also prevail over the upcoming tech earnings season. However, he argues, ""when I look at the return on investment for the hyperscalers and for the entire technology sector, I actually think we're starting to see it."" He points to Meta Platforms (META) as an example, explaining, ""At one point during the year, people thought that Meta would have Q4 growth rates in the mid-single digits. Now, that number is closer to 20%. And why is that? That's because they've been able to use AI to get a lot better targeting in their core advertising business."" He also believes that Apple (AAPL) will see the beginning of an upgrade cycle as it offers AI capabilities on its iPhone 16 series. In addition, he argues that Nvidia (NVDA) is in the best position as the company is ""selling the linchpin technology to all of these vendors."" While the Magnificent Seven has been under pressure, Rizzo tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think the divergence that we've seen amongst the Magnificent Seven, and between the Mag Seven and the S&P 493, is really quite natural."" Rizzo notes that the Magnificent Seven has historically grown earnings at a rate of 50 to 100% faster than the rest of the S&P 500. He expects that to continue over the medium term, especially as many of the Magnificent Seven players are well-positioned for AI. However, at this moment, he explains that they are trading only at a 50% premium to the rest of the market, making them cheaper based on a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. He finds AI will continue to drive innovation and push further growth in mega-cap tech names. With this dynamic at play, Rizzo expects the AI chip market to grow to $400 billion by 2027.

"Jobless claims data, market volatility, China stocks: Morning Brief",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/jobless-claims-data-market-volatility-182011183.html,"On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market and report on some of the biggest stories of the trading day. All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley Léger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, ""when are they perfectly certain?"" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that ""through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward."" Due to this dynamic, Léger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout ""Magnificent Seven"" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership ""hit an abrupt stop"" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes ""it's too early to give up"" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt’s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. “The growth supports the multiple… The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta’s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the ""very, very early innings."" With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, ""Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield.""

Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.” Crockett explains. He says, “Frankly, I think the big worry on the stock historically has been spending, right? In particular, their investments in their reality segment, which, I think, are overdone and are not going to generate a return that we think pencils out commensurate to the investment. But they are executing better. The devices that they were showing off at their recent Meta Connect [are] more resonant with the consumer than even what Apple is doing right now. And their Ray-Ban glasses could actually be something of a hit this Christmas.” Despite the analyst's view that Meta's investments in the reality segment won't necessarily pay off, he explains Meta can afford the project. ""The amazing thing is that they don't ever have to make money in this. We don't assume they do. For the earnings growth to be impressive enough and to support the equity from here, you know, if they did, that'd be a huge upside, there. You know, we think on pace to lose 17 billion-ish this year in operating profit on reality. And that's going to be more than they lost last year. They probably lost 60 billion cumulatively on this. And yet they're growing EPS."" Crockett says Meta is ""so strong in the advertising marketing that they can support this basically dreamer's tax on reality, and you can still make a great argument for the stock.""He explains, ""These guys were growing their advertising revenues at a 20% year-over-year pace in the quarter that was reported for June. We think they'll keep growing at close to that pace in the September ending quarter. That's going to put them up at the very fastest growers in advertising. Nearly twice the growth rate of Google and right on top of what Amazon is doing with their new ad push and not too far behind the connected TV darling, the Trade Desk... These guys are large.

"Port strike, AI hiring, easing inflation: Asking for a Trend",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/port-strike-ai-hiring-easing-224721555.html,"On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the top stories and key themes from the trading week. Tens of thousands of dock workers could strike next week at cargo ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. The strike could have major implications for the US economy as it also adds to the mounting uncertainty around the 2024 presidential election. Yahoo Finance Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul breaks down how the Biden administration is handling the looming strike and how it could impact the election. Meanwhile, consumers may be wondering if holiday shopping could be impacted by the strike. Naveen Jaggi, JLL Americas president of retail, tells Yahoo Finance, “In terms of holiday product, [retailers] have their product in the States, they have their distribution centers or at the stores… Most of the items that are being sold, the toys, the electronics and the soft goods, clothings, that are pretty predominant when it comes to holiday sales, those come from Asia,” meaning they would not be affected by the port workers on the East and Gulf Coasts going on strike. Mercor CEO Brendan Foody joins the show to discuss how Mercor uses artificial intelligence to make the hiring process more efficient. Foody explains, “Mercor is able to automate all of those [HR] processes with [large language models (LLMs)] not only far more scalably but also far more effectively. We've processed over 300,000 candidates, conducted hundreds of thousands of verbal interviews asking nuanced questions about people's backgrounds, and matched thousands of people with jobs.” Mercor trains LLMs, predominantly OpenAI’s GPT series and Meta's (META) Llama models, on “all the proprietary data we have on candidates to best understand who's going to perform well at a given job, for what reasons,” Foody says. The Federal Reserve has officially kicked off its rate-cutting cycle as it eyes a 2% inflation target. But some economists are skeptical about whether a soft landing can actually be achieved. Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman analyzes whether the US economy has the right conditions for a soft landing.

This is the latest of a slew of tech companies who have been subject to regulatory overhang. RBC Capital Markets equity analyst Brad Erickson joins Catalysts to discuss why the regulatory challenges facing Big Tech companies should have little to no impact on investment strategies. Erickson explains that the Department of Justice is currently drafting a proposal for the judge in the default search case, outlining how they plan to ""remedy Google's ability to secure search status"" on smartphones. The DOJ has until December to submit this proposal, with the judge expected to rule by August 2025. However, Erickson notes that Google's planned appeal could extend the legal battle for several years. Due to this lengthy process, he believes Google's business ""isn't fundamentally about to change in sort of a seismic way,"" making the stock attractive at current levels. Addressing the broader regulatory landscape across the tech sector, Erickson states, ""Our kind of holistic view across the space, certainly for the companies we follow like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) ... the businesses are so far down the road.

Erickson believes that tech giants like Meta ""are going to keep spending money on this stuff."" With Meta revealing only a prototype to investors at it's Connect Conference, Erickson sees this as a positive sign for the company's upcoming quarterly results. Erickson notes a strong correlation between AI spending and revenue growth, stating, ""management recognizes that they can't just go spend an unlimited amount of dollars unless the business is growing fast enough."" ""So long as those fundamental trends are good, it gives them license to go out and keep spending on this, and thus we kind of view the spending as the tip of the spear indicator.

If you look at the overall market, OpenAI no longer has a massive technology lead. If you look at what Meta (META) was talking about this week, they've provided their best model to the open source for free.” Windsor says the $150 billion price tag is “an optimistic scenario for a company where almost all of the founders have left.
