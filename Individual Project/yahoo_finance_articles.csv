Amazon-Talen deal rejection is 'short-term setback' for Big Tech,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-talen-deal-rejection-short-230222241.html,"US regulators rejected a deal that would have allowed Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), to buy power from Talen Energy (TLN) for its data centers. The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

CFRA Research senior equity research analyst Arun Sundaram joins Market Domination Overtime Hosts Alexandra Canal and Josh Lipton to discuss the results and break down why the market is less concerned with Amazon’s artificial intelligence (AI) spending compared to its peers. “Really, you got the you got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,” Sundaram says. The analyst explains that while all the cloud hyperscalers are ramping up their capital spending to invest in AI, investors seem less concerned about Amazon’s AI spending compared to Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT). He says, “There's a few unique things” with Amazon,” including “Amazon's not solely reliant on chips from Nvidia” as “ they also build and create their own AI chips that are more cost-effective and of more value. So they may not be seeing the same type of capacity constraint issues that Microsoft is seeing at the moment.” Sundaram notes, “The other thing I would point out too is, you know, Amazon has multiple levers to grow margins,” including their e-commerce business, advertising, Amazon Web Services, and other segments.

With a “high-flying stock like Meta, you need much more high-flying numbers than what they reported yesterday,” Kulkarni says. He explains there were factors that he considers ""yellow flag[s],"" including some quarterly results coming in “slightly below the elevated expectations that we had heard from investors” and the open-ended question on 2025's CapEx (capital expenditures) spending. Despite noting some signs of caution, Kulkarni says “Today is the time to buy,” given “there is going to be an air pocket in Facebook shares” since “there is this period where you have a very important Q4 [fourth quarter] coming up and then an equally important guidance for spend coming up.” The analyst says he expects there will be “a lot of new improvement coming up where they're targeting, that engagement, better advertiser ROI [return on investment], better consumer time spent, all of those things just start to amplify the classic flywheel that you want in a network like Facebook.

The tech giant posted adjusted earnings of $6.03 per share, above the $5.25 Wall Street expected, and revenue of $40.59 billion, exceeding the projected $40.25 billion. Despite the quarterly beat, the stock experienced a post-earnings decline. Seaport Research Partners senior analyst Aaron Kessler joined Market Domination Overtime to explain this diverging market reaction. According to Kessler, market expectations for Meta were ""relatively high"" leading up to the earnings report. While the company beat street expectations, he notes that given the stock's strong performance before the announcement, he's ""not surprised to see it down a little bit."" Addressing Meta's AI strategy, Kessler identifies two key approaches: internal applications for automating advertising systems and operations and long-term initiatives to develop generative AI products and services.

Mag 7 earnings underline the group's huge market influence,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/magnificent-7-earnings-underline-groups-211200909.html,"Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) delivered an earnings beat, sending the stock higher and fueling confidence in the “Magnificent Seven” group. With Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL) set to report this week, Capital Fund Management head of macro strategy Christian Dery joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the impact of the Magnificent Seven on the broader market. “These companies have gotten so large that on earnings events…you're getting these swings in market cap on the order of $2 [billion] to $400 billion,” Dery says, highlighting Nvidia (NVDA) and its impact on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) specifically. The chipmaker doesn’t report earnings until Nov. 20. As the Magnificent Seven companies report earnings, capital spending will likely be closely watched by investors as Big Tech companies invest billions into artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure without a definitive timeline on AI monetization. The strategist says, “The reality is that the existing incumbents have to build out this technology because they can't risk falling behind their competitors,” but “We haven't found the killer use case just yet, and the market is going to start to be more discerning in terms of [the] path to profitability scale. They're going to focus on CapEx and projections for CapEx.” For more on how Dery navigates investing in the Magnificent Seven, watch the video above.

Apple needs AI hype to drive upgrades but can't disappoint users,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-needs-ai-hype-drive-203022822.html,"Apple's (AAPL) earnings bring Apple Intelligence into focus as the iPhone maker rolls out its artificial intelligence (AI) features, hoping to drive an accelerated device upgrade cycle. Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the balancing act Apple needs to perform in building excitement around Apple Intelligence to drive upgrades while not overpromising and disappointing users. Bajarin talks about the ""unpredictability"" that Apple Intelligence presents for Apple and investors trying to gauge how the tech could drive an upgrade cycle. ""It's been hard to look back on the history of a couple [of] decades of consumer electronics and really see software itself drive a hardware cycle. It's typically been very hardware-driven, and I think that's the hardest comp that many of us are having to make is to really look at how much of a software angle is actually going to drive a hardware cycle when.... that's not really a comp that we've had before."" ""I think Apple Intelligence is the most mature kind of consumer AI implementation at a system level for customers,"" he says, but notes that ""Apple's now got to go market and tell that message and make it clear to consumers why are they going to want to use these features."" The analyst says while Apple is ""in a unique position to onboard and help mature experiences with this software,"" he worries ""that people are coming from either too high of expectations or really no expectations at all because it's not really a driver for them to go and want to use these devices.""

Apple's delayed AI launch a 'real risk' to upgrade cycle: Analyst,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apples-delayed-ai-launch-real-165430949.html,"Apple (AAPL) may have beat fiscal fourth quarter revenue estimates with $94.9 billion (estimates were for $94.3 billion), but adjusted earnings fell far below Wall Street's expectations due to a one-time charge from a European General Court decision. While Apple's Greater China sales also fell below estimates, the tech giant blew past iPhone sales estimates, posting $46.22 billion against estimates of $45.04 billion. To speak more about Apple's latest earnings print and its position in the Magnificent Seven, Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Seana Smith on Catalysts. ""It looks to be a very slow developing supercycle for AI inspired upgrades for the iPhone. And the reason I say that is they had 5.5% growth in iPhone revenue in the September quarter, and they're guiding to total company revenue growth of low single-digit,"" Forte says. ""So I think the two noisy points in the data are that China macroeconomic weakness — China's about 15% of revenue — I think that's making it hard to determine if we're seeing a supercycle and the other is that there was a mismatch in the timing"" of the iPhone 16 launch and the later Apple Intelligence software update. Forte denotes the delay in the release of Apple's AI features for the new iPhone model could be a ""real risk"" to Apple's consumer upgrade cycle. Forte also weighs in on Apple's guidance and why he's still seeing Amazon (AMZN) as a top Big Tech pick.

Constellation Energy's dip is buying opportunity into nuclear: Analyst,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/constellation-energys-dip-buying-opportunity-173000956.html,"Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) have fallen as much as 12% today in tandem with other nuclear energy names, after government regulators blocked Amazon's (AMZN) power agreement with provider Talen Energy (TLN). CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.&nbsp; Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech — Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to America’s economic competitiveness and national security can’t be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). For more coverage on Big Tech's adoption of nuclear energy, catch Yahoo Finance's interviews with X-energy CEO Clay Sell about Amazon's investment into the nuclear reactor designer, Kairos Power Co-Founder and CEO Mike Laufer's input on the nuclear startup's partnership with Google, and Oklo (OKLO) Co-Founder and CEO Jake DeWitte who explains the business model for nuclear energy providers.

Uber is transitioning into a 'software company': Investor,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/uber-transitioning-software-company-investor-143431443.html,"Uber (UBER) reported third quarter results, beating Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings. The rideshare platform posted revenue of $11.19 billion, surpassing estimates of $10.99 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.20, significantly higher than the anticipated $0.45. Despite these positive metrics, Uber's stock faced pressure due to weaker-than-expected gross bookings and a reduced fourth quarter outlook. Kindred Ventures Founder and managing partner Steve Jang joins Morning Brief to provide insights into Uber's performance and future potential. ""The company is starting to show that it's not just a marketplace company but a software company,"" Jang says, highlighting Uber's profitability and continued growth opportunities. Jang emphasizes Uber's strategic positioning, pointing to potential expansion in autonomous and electric vehicles. He praises the company's cost-consciousness and ability to apply its software network across ridesharing, delivery, and freight services. ""Uber is the demand network,"" Jang states, arguing that emerging technologies like Waymo and Tesla's (TSLA) autonomous vehicles will take time to impact the market. However, Uber's global network, software, and 24/7 operations provide a competitive advantage that these companies may want to use in the future.

Jones emphasizes that Amazon's AI investments are critical to maintaining its competitive edge. ""AI is this massive, massive opportunity. We're only a year or so into the opportunity, so we're probably looking at a very long runway of spend,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. The company plans to invest $75 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, and in 2025 ""they'll likely spend more.""
